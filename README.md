Sessions is an application that finds breweries near surf spots. 
It uses data from the SpitCast surf forcast API to find surf spot
location and forcast information. The BreweryDB API is then used
to find breweries close to the selected surf spot. Finally, the 
Google Maps API is used to display the results. 

It is written in HTML/Javascript/CSS in combination with the JQuery
library and Bootstrap framework. Pinegrow was also used for styling.

It was created by Seth Brown as a part of the Thinkful Bootcamp.
